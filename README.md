# Abstract

## Neural Network Classification of Gender in Audio Streams

This project aims to train a neural network model to classify
audio stream samples along a spectrum from masculine to
feminine. The primary data will be a randomly-selected subset of
the Mozilla Common Voice Data Set. The model produced will be
useful primarily in helping transgender users to learn to use
their voices in ways that match their proper gender, as the
model will be able to provide realtime feedback.
