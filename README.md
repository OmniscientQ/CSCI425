# CSCI425
Python Machine Learning Project

# Abstract
This project aims to train a machine learning model to classify audio stream samples along a spectrum from masculine to feminine. The primary data will be a randomly-selected subset of the Mozilla Common Voice Data Set.

The model produced will be useful primarily in helping transgender users to learn to use their voices in ways that match their proper gender, as the model will be able to provide realtime feedback.
